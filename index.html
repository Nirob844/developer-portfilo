                I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my friend how
                to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
